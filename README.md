## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

### MVVM-C with Clean Architecture

This app adopts a **hybrid architecture** combining:

- **MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator)**: Ensures separation of navigation logic using Coordinators and keeps ViewModels focused on state and business handling.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separates concerns across layers â€” `Presentation`, `Domain`, and `Data`.
